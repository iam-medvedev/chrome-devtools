## Insight title: LCP by phase

## Insight Description:
This insight is used to analyze the time spent that contributed to the final LCP time and identify which of the 4 phases (or 2 if there was no LCP resource) are contributing most to the delay in rendering the LCP element. For this insight it can be useful to get a list of all network requests that happened before the LCP time and look for slow requests. You can also look for main thread activity during the phases, in particular the load delay and render delay phases.

## Insight details:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 129.21 ms.
The LCP resource was fetched from \`${insight.lcpRequest.args.data.url}\`.

We can break this time down into the 4 phases that combine to make up the LCP time:

- Time to first byte: 7.94 ms
- Load delay: 33.16 ms
- Load time: 14.70 ms
- Render delay: 73.41 ms`;

## Insight title: Render blocking requests

## Insight Description:
This insight identifies network requests that were render blocking. Render blocking requests are impactful because they are deemed critical to the page and therefore the browser stops rendering the page until it has dealt with these resources. For this insight make sure you fully inspect the details of each render blocking network request and prioritize your suggestions to the user based on the impact of each render blocking request.

## Insight details:
Here is a list of the network requests that were render blocking on this page and their duration:

## Network request: https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.js

- Duration: 1,362.65 ms
- MIME type: application/javascript

- Start time: 581.60 ms
- Duration: 611.56 ms
- MIME type: text/css
- This request was render blocking

## Network request: http://localhost:8000/render-blocking-script.js

## Insight title: LCP request discovery

## Insight Description:
This insight analyzes the time taken to discover the LCP resource and request it on the network. It only applies if LCP element was a resource like an image that has to be fetched over the network. There are 3 checks this insight makes:
1. Did the resource have \`fetchpriority=high\` applied?
2. Was the resource discoverable in the initial document, rather than injected from a script or stylesheet?
3. The resource was not lazy loaded as this can delay the browser loading the resource.

It is important that all of these checks pass to minimize the delay between the initial page load and the LCP resource being loaded.

## External resources:
- https://web.dev/articles/lcp
- https://web.dev/articles/optimize-lcp

## Insight details:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 1,077.06 ms.
The LCP resource was fetched from \`${insight.lcpRequest.args.data.url}\`.

The result of the checks for this insight are:
- fetchpriority=high should be applied: FAILED
- lazy load not applied: PASSED
- Request is discoverable in initial document: PASSED`;

## Insight title: Document request latency

## Insight Description:
This insight checks that the first request is responded to promptly. We use the following criteria to check this:
1. Was the initial request redirected?
2. Did the server respond in 600ms or less? We want developers to aim for as close to 100ms as possible, but our threshold for this insight is 600ms.
3. Was there compression applied to the response to minimize the transfer size?

## Insight details:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 3,604.15 ms.
The LCP is text based and was not fetched from the network.
