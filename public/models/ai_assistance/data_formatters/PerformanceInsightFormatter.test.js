## Insight Summary:
This insight is used to analyze the time spent that contributed to the final LCP time and identify which of the 4 phases (or 2 if there was no LCP resource) are contributing most to the delay in rendering the LCP element.

## Detailed analysis:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 129.21 ms.
The LCP resource was fetched from \`${insight.lcpRequest.args.data.url}\`.

We can break this time down into the 4 phases that combine to make the LCP time:

- Time to first byte: 7.94 ms (6.1% of total LCP time)
- Resource load delay: 33.16 ms (25.7% of total LCP time)
- Resource load duration: 14.70 ms (11.4% of total LCP time)
- Element render delay: 73.41 ms (56.8% of total LCP time)

## Insight Summary:
This insight analyzes the time taken to discover the LCP resource and request it on the network. It only applies if LCP element was a resource like an image that has to be fetched over the network. There are 3 checks this insight makes:
1. Did the resource have \`fetchpriority=high\` applied?
2. Was the resource discoverable in the initial document, rather than injected from a script or stylesheet?
3. The resource was not lazy loaded as this can delay the browser loading the resource.

It is important that all of these checks pass to minimize the delay between the initial page load and the LCP resource being loaded.

## Detailed analysis:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 1,077.06 ms.
The LCP resource was fetched from \`${insight.lcpRequest.args.data.url}\`.

The result of the checks for this insight are:
- fetchpriority=high should be applied: FAILED
- lazy load not applied: PASSED
- Request is discoverable in initial document: PASSED

## Insight Summary:
This insight checks that the first request is responded to promptly. We use the following criteria to check this:
1. Was the initial request redirected?
2. Did the server respond in 600ms or less? We want developers to aim for as close to 100ms as possible, but our threshold for this insight is 600ms.
3. Was there compression applied to the response to minimize the transfer size?

## Detailed analysis:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 3,604.15 ms.
The LCP is text based and was not fetched from the network.

The result of the checks for this insight are:
- The request was not redirected: FAILED

## Insight Summary:
Cumulative Layout Shifts (CLS) is a measure of the largest burst of layout shifts for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the lifecycle of a page. This is a Core Web Vital and the thresholds for categorizing a score are:
- Good: 0.1 or less
- Needs improvement: more than 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.25
- Bad: over 0.25

## Detailed analysis:
The worst layout shift cluster was the cluster that started at 471.76 ms and ended at 3,342.83 ms, with a duration of 2,871.07 ms.
The score for this cluster is 0.7656.

Layout shifts in this cluster:
### Layout shift 1:
- Start time: 471.76 ms
- Score: 0.0003
- Potential root causes:
  - A font that was loaded over the network (https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/specialgothicexpandedone/v2/IurO6Zxk74-YaYk1r3HOet4g75ENmBxUmOK61tA0Iu5QmJF_.woff2).
### Layout shift 2:
- Start time: 857.25 ms
- Score: 0.0844
- Potential root causes:
  - An iframe (id: 8AF3A9ADB81CA7B35302D07E0B591104, url: https://www.google.com/ was injected into the page)
### Layout shift 3:
- Start time: 1,352.45 ms
- Score: 0.0068
- Potential root causes:
  - An unsized image (IMG) (url: http://localhost:8000/unsized-image.png).
### Layout shift 4:
- Start time: 1,537.46 ms
- Score: 0.3344
- Potential root causes:
  - An unsized image (IMG) (url: http://localhost:8000/unsized-image.png).
### Layout shift 5:
- Start time: 2,342.83 ms
- Score: 0.3396
- No potential root causes identified

## Insight Summary:
Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a metric that tracks the responsiveness of the page when the user interacts with it. INP is a Core Web Vital and the thresholds for how we categorize a score are:
- Good: 200 milliseconds or less.
- Needs improvement: more than 200 milliseconds and 500 milliseconds or less.
- Bad: over 500 milliseconds.

For a given slow interaction, we can break it down into 3 phases:
1. Input delay: starts when the user initiates an interaction with the page, and ends when the event callbacks for the interaction begin to run.
2. Processing duration: the time it takes for the event callbacks to run to completion.
3. Presentation delay: the time it takes for the browser to present the next frame which contains the visual result of the interaction.

The sum of these three phases is the total latency. It is important to optimize each of these phases to ensure interactions take as little time as possible. Focusing on the phase that has the largest score is a good way to start optimizing.

## Detailed analysis:
The longest interaction on the page was a \`click\` which had a total duration of \`979.97 ms\`. The timings of each of the three phases were:

1. Input delay: 1.00 ms
2. Processing duration: 977.00 ms
3. Presentation delay: 1.97 ms.
