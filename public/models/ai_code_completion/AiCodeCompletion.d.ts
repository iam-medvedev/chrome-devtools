/**
 * The AiCodeCompletion class is responsible for fetching code completion suggestions
 * from the AIDA backend and displaying them in the text editor.
 *
 * 1. **Debouncing requests:** As the user types, we don't want to send a request
 *    for every keystroke. Instead, we use debouncing to schedule a request
 *    only after the user has paused typing for a short period
 *    (AIDA_REQUEST_THROTTLER_TIMEOUT_MS). This prevents spamming the backend with
 *    requests for intermediate typing states.
 *
 * 2. **Delaying suggestions:** When a suggestion is received from the AIDA
 *    backend, we don't show it immediately. There is a minimum delay
 *    (DELAY_BEFORE_SHOWING_RESPONSE_MS) from when the request was sent to when
 *    the suggestion is displayed.
