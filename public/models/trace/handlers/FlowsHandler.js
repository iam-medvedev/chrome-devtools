// A flow is a logic connection between trace events. We display this
// connection as arrows between trace events belonging to the same flow.
// In the trace event format, flows are represented with pairing "flow
// phase" events. Each flow phase event corresponds to one trace event
// and indicates the role a trace event plays in a flow (start, step or
// end). For each flow, one `start` and one `end` phase events are
// included, while the amount of `step` phase events can be >= 0.
// A flow phase event is assigned to a trace event when their cat, tid,
// pid and ts are equal (see @flowPhaseBindingTokenForEvent ).
// It's possible for a single event to belong to multiple flows. In that
// case, it will have multiple corresponding flow phase events (one
// per flow).
// To parse flows, we first handle flow phase events, by creating unique
// flows with the timestamps of each phase. Then, we place trace events
// in the flows where their corresponding phase events were placed (if
// there are any corresponding flow phase events at all).
