 * from raw bytes requires an encoding.
 *
 * Note that we only rarely have to decode text ourselves in the frontend,
 * this is mostly handled by the backend. There are cases though (e.g. SVG,
 * or streaming response content) where we receive text data in
 * binary (base64-encoded) form.
 *
 * The class only implements decoding. We currently don't have a use-case
 * to re-encode text into base64 bytes using a specified charset.
